## 1. Overview

This style definition provides a dark mode theme for Google Maps. The style focuses on a minimalist and dark color scheme, emphasizing roads and bodies of water, while de-emphasizing labels and icons.

## 2. Style Definitions

The style definition uses a series of rules to adjust the visual appearance of different map features. Each rule targets a specific `featureType` (e.g., `road`, `water`, `poi`) and an `elementType` (e.g., `geometry`, `labels`, `labels.text`) to apply specific `stylers`.

| Feature Type          | Element Type        | Stylers                                                               | Description                                                                                                         |
